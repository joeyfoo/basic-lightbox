# basic-lightbox

A basic vanilla Javascript lightbox script with no dependencies and a single `<script>` include.

## How to use

### Adding the script

Download and include the `lightbox.js` script at the bottom of your `<body>` tag.

    <script src="path/to/lightbox.js"></script>

### Triggering the lightbox

**Images:** Add a `data-lightbox` attribute to an image link. 

    <a href="path/to/full-size-image.jpg" data-lightbox="This is an example photo embed.">...</a>

**YouTube:** Same as images, except use a link that starts with `https://www.youtube.com/watch`.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C61bhu8eI3o" data-lightbox="This is an example YouTube embed.">...</a>
